🏖️ Vacation World
Welcome to Vacation World — a fun and beginner-friendly project that showcases top travel destinations using basic HTML and CSS!

📘 What This Project Is
This webpage displays:

A title, author, and publish time.

Descriptions of three amazing vacation destinations: Florence, Beijing, and Seoul.

A list of other destinations to explore.

Clickable “Learn More” links to external travel pages.

It's styled using CSS to bring color, fonts, and layout to life.

🛠️ What I Learned
Working on this project helped me practice and understand:

🧱 HTML Skills
How to structure content using elements like h1, p, ul, div, and a.

How to organize information with semantic tags and meaningful class/id names.

How to add images and links with custom behaviors (like opening in a new tab).

🎨 CSS Skills
How to apply styles using class selectors, ID selectors, and element selectors.

How to use attribute selectors to style specific links (e.g., based on destination).

How to use pseudo-classes like :hover for interactive effects.

How to use fonts, colors, and backgrounds to enhance visual appeal.

How to apply styles selectively using combinations of selectors (e.g., .description h5, li h4).

🧪 Other Things I Explored
Using the * selector to visualize borders on every element (great for debugging layout!).

The difference between class and ID selectors.

How CSS rules cascade and override each other.
